# hey!
I am a PhD Candidate at Maastricht University working at the [Institute of Data Science](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/institute-data-science) and [Studio Europa](https://maastrichteurope.nl).

My research research focuses on using computational methods to analyse the interaction between internet monetisation, content creators, and social media users.
