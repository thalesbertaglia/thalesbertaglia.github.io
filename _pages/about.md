Hi! I'm Thales Bertaglia, a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Law, Economics, and Governance at Utrecht University. Iâ€™m currently working on the ERC Starting Grant [HUMANads](https://humanads.eu), which focuses on understanding the impact of content monetisation on social media and reinterpreting private law fairness in platform governance. My work bridges computational social science, digital governance, and legal perspectives, with a focus on empowering stakeholders and making digital ecosystems more transparent, accountable, and fair.

I study the creator economy and, more broadly, social media platforms, investigating how content monetisation, algorithmic systems, and platform regulation interact. My research combines machine learning, natural language processing, and other computational methods to develop tools for detecting online harms, evaluating the impact of governance interventions, and operationalising legal norms into computational tasks. I am particularly interested in building reproducible, explainable, and legally grounded AI systems that support users, creators, researchers, and regulators.
