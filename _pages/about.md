Hi! I'm Thales Bertaglia, a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Law, Economics, and Governance at Utrecht University. Iâ€™m currently working on the ERC Starting Grant [HUMANads](https://humanads.eu), which focuses on understanding the impact of content monetisation on social media and reinterpreting private law fairness in platform governance.

My research investigates the creator economy on social media, examining how influencers monetise their content and the socio-legal implications of these practices. I develop computational methods, primarily based on NLP, to address challenges such as measuring toxicity, detecting sponsored content, and ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance. In practice, I integrate interdisciplinary insights from law and social sciences into computational tasks, creating annotation frameworks, machine learning models, and data resources.

I am currently focusing on the intersection of political speech and social media, analysing how influencers engage in political advertising and the regulatory complexities that arise from these activities. From a technical perspective, I am interested in approaches for operationalising political speech as NLP tasks and integrating sociolinguistic context into large language models, particularly for legal applications. My work aims to provide empirical evidence and practical solutions to improve transparency within the creator economy.
